 <p><strong>Can Silver oaks students perform on par with CBSE or ICSE students?</p></strong>
 <p class="answer">Even though we believe in a character first and competence next approach, we prepare our students to be life long<br>
  learners whose quest is to gain and apply academic and practical knowledge. Our teachers integrate the<br>
   textbooks into everyday life with our ISAP and Big History Project modules to ensure a more comprehensive approach that enable<br>
    our students to perform excellently in CBSE, along with an unparalleled performance in ASSET, Olympiads, NIAS, etc.</p>
<p><strong> How often is PTM held?</p></strong>
<p class="answer">PTM / SLC (Student Led Conference) are held for every 50 working days (approx. 2 months). Dates will be communicated at the start of academic session.</p>
<p><strong>What is Mindspark ?</p></strong>
<p class="answer">Mindspark is a computer based program that revolutionizes the study of Mathematics.<br>
 It focuses on self-learning with a curriculum integrated database. An interactive product, from the makers of ASSET,<br>
  Mindspark has been derived from the belief of personalized learning. It is specially designed to assist the user to learn at his or her pace.
<br>
Students learn best at their own pace. Mindspark enables children to learn and understand at their own pace, without rushing them through the syllabus.<br>
 With an active and detailed database, Mindspark monitors the level of understanding in each concept and patiently helps the students when<br>
  they are in doubt by resolving errors and misconceptions through explanations.
<br>
For example, if a student from the 8th grade does not have clarity on the core concepts of Algebra, the system automatically offers inputs in the form of questions <br>
that will help build the fundamentals of Equivalence (which is a critical point into understanding Algebra).
<br>
Currently more than 100+ schools spread across India have integrated Mindspark along with their Maths curriculum teaching.</p>
